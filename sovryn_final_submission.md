 ## Ideas for Increasing TVL ##
**What motivates people to lock their assets into a protocol?**

There are many triggering points that make people to lock up their funds in the protocol. here are my few observations that we can  use to increase TVL

- first major motivation people want to lock up their funds is lending your stable coins and cryptocurrency to earn interest on them.
- Now to get a good interest rate in the protocol. people need to start borrowing from the system. which can only happen through margin
trading right now. we can more financial product from which we will make people look more funds 
- Now to get people to trade on the platform you need to create trust
- trust can be achieved in two ways one by word of mouth marketing(which will happen when there are incentives to promoter and user both) and regular   digital marketing 
- the above reasons are the main factors to increase TVL 
- here are a few more things which you can do adding other chains(Solana,ADA,DOT) and adding other stable coins and cryptocurrencies like(tusd,gusd,husd, sol,dot,ada) but these moves might not bring huge change as the same impact marketing dose
- In marketing under referral section we can use a system like  binanace would work like a charm

## Ideas for origins ##
For origins platform, there are broadly two-aspect 

1)project who are going to launch projects on origins 

2)users who are going to invest in projects through the origins platform 

### project who are going to launch projects on origins ### 
Projects can launch an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) all in a streamlined, end-to-end process.
- As they are using the platform they get access to community and sovryn liquidity access from which they can kickstart the project
-  They can get access to VC which are partnered with origins platforms 
- Integration of sovryn bitocracy system till they build they own governance system  
- The funds can be locked and released based on the milestone of the project or roadmap
- They can run private and seed sales easily
- Projects can choose in which format they want to run sale
  - First come first serve model: All participants are able to contribute until the pool reaches the total max cap for funds.
  - Guaranteed proportional model: All participants who contribute within the open time period of the pool receive an allocation proportional to their contributed funds as a percentage of total funds contributed. In the case that total funds exceed the max cap of the pool, additional funds will be returned.
  - Lottery model: where there are a set of winners.Selected for sale through lottery mechanism 
  - Instant AMA listing after-sales period completes 

### users who are going to invest in projects through the origins platform ### 
    
 As mentioned above there are many ways a project can select to launch ido.
 - To access the origins platform people need to stake sov and based on the staking power they might allocation or access to the specific pool
 - To incentivize long to term holders you can provide access to exclusive private sales only for long term holders
 -  Airdrops from sov stakers(depends on the project are they are willing to do airdrop or not)
 -  finally, one community pool where everyone can participate if the user is staked sov or not

## Incentivizing Stakers in Governance ##
As far as the current bitocracy model the Stakers are incentivized fair enough.
- the problem right now is there nothing much is going on sovryn protocol so they are not able to get good rewards.
- when more financial products and origins platforms come into play. The Stakers will able to see the benefits of staking 
- So we need to incentivize the Stakers till more activity and development happens. these funds can be taken from adoption funds


<div id="protocol-idea"></div>

## Ideas to develop the protocol ##
 - As we are experiencing an NFT boom right now we can create similar platforms like origins or we can add NFT launchpad feature to the origins platform
-where people  can launch their NFT's and can trade NFT
- Bringing synthetic asset to sovryn platform as fast as possible is a great idea because can capture huge market share 
- crypto Index funds can be an amazing product where people can directly invest. 
- We can create a special crypto synthetic index fund where the index fund consists a blend of synthetic assets and crypto-assets. which can give good growth and balanced risk. many people may use this product

In all aspects at the current conditions of the sovryn ecosystem.

It is my hope the research presented in this paper has served the purpose to solve the current problem
